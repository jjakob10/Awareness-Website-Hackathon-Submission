            War and International Humanitarian Law
          </h1>
          <p id="guts">
            Since the beginning of time, humans have resorted to violence to settle disputes. Countries have gone to wars against each other and while wars are catastrophic events that are avoided, they have never ceased to exist and have only evolved and gotten deadlier, faster, and more reliant on technology. Wars often leave civilians, inhabitants who are not participating in the fighting, desperate for the necessities to stay alive. That is why the Humanitarian International Law came into place across the world, to limit the effects of war on civilians. The International Humanitarian Law established the right for injured, sick, and wounded combatants to receive medical care and attention, limits the types of warfare technology that should be used, and makes the killing of civilians illegal. However, many civilians continuously are fatally impacted by wars. Women, children, eldrely, and the sick who are ot engaged in the conflict lose their lives and loved ones. As of 2019, there have been over 335,000 civilians in countries including Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria, and Pakistan that have died violent deaths as a direct result of the wars. As society advances and technology becomes more powerful, extraordinary efforts are needed to ensure the safety of civilians and reduce the catastrophic damages of war.
