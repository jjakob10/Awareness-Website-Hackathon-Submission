      <h2>Old Technology</h2>
        <div class="item-container">
          <h4>Cannon</h4>
          <img class="qr-code" src="/assets/Cannon.png"></image>
          <p>The cannon is a 12th century large-caliber gun that has suffered several updates and is still used nowadays in different configurations such as ship cannons or tank cannons. It's classified as a type of artillery. It was widely used by many people.
Cannons vary in gauge, effective range, mobility, rate of fire, angle of fire and firepower; different forms of cannon combine and balance these attributes in varying degrees. </p>

      <h2>Current Technology</h2>
        <div class="item-container">
          <h4>B2 Spirit (Strategic Bomber)</h4>
          <img class="qr-code" src="/assets/B2.png"></image>
          <p>Developed in the Cold War, the B2 Spirit is still the most advanced strategic bomber in the world. It can pass as almost invisible in radars running several miles over the world carring up to 40,000 pounds of weapons or bombs. It's the most expensive airplane in history.</p>

          <h4>General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper (drone)</h4>
          <img class="qr-code" src="/assets/drone.png"></image>
          <p>General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper is a unmanned aerial vehicle (drone). It's the biggest of its category having 15x more cargo capacity than its predecessor.</p>

    <h2>Future Technology</h2>
       <div class="item-container">
          <h4>Mech and other automonus robots and weapons</h4>
          <img class="qr-code" src="/assets/mech.png"></image>
          <p>It's difficult to predict the future, but we can guess, as the things are getting more automatic and less dependent on humans, the next generation of weapons will count on artificial inteligence and other advanced technologies to be self controlled.</p>
